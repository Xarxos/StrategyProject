/*
TODO
----

- Implement actual Bedrock data for every tile within one region.
- Make it so that you can enter that region from the world map.
- Implement specific tile data boxes for each of those tiles that can properly display their Bedrock data.

- Put generalfunctions into a namespace probably.
- Consider creating a separate WorldGenerator class or something. Or implement it as its own separate program altogether which writes to text files and then import those text files
	to the actual game.
